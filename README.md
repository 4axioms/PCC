PCC - People's Canada Coin
A fungible token made on the Bitcoin Cash network to promote the PPC(The People's Party of Canada)
NOTE: PCC - PEOPLE'S CANADA COIN IS NOT OFFICIALLY ENDORSED OR AFFILIATED WITH THE CANADIAN POLITICAL PARTY CALLED THE "PEOPLE'S PARTY OF CANADA"
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

As stated above, the PCC(People's Canada Coin) was made to promote and bring about awareness about the People's Party of Canada, and furthermore to expose more 
Canadians to the party's web site and platform in a novel fun way. It is also meant as a teaching tool to expose more people to Bitcoin Cash and the CashTokens 
protocol that runs on the Bitcoin Cash network.

There was recently some controversy on the X platform regarding and account called @VforXRP who made a PPC Coin token on XRP. @VforXRP was accused of grifting 
and potentially exit scamming even though there was no evidence suggesting that he had any nefarious intent. In fact, the evidence suggested that he was merely 
aiming to achieve what the People's Canada Coin is aiming to achieve. Many X PPC heavyweight accounts dogpiled and slandered @VforXRP for his attempt at trying 
something novel—this was primarily due to ignorance and unfamiliarity with the technology(blockchains, crypto, and tokens) being used as a medium to increase 
visibility of the People's Party of Canada.

Fundamentally, because money is involved with cryptocurrencies and tokens...people are naturally suspicious(once again, this is due to ignorance). With that being 
said...I have learned from @VforXRP's "mistakes"—it's questionable whether he actually did anything wrong(I think that he did nothing wrong). The People's Canada 
Coin will issue 21 quadrillion coins(tokens), thus ensuring that the token never gains any real monetary value beyond being worth mere fractions of a CAD penny. Also,
the 21 quadrillion coins will be issued to me(the default behaviour when issuing fungible CashTokens), and I will subsequently distribute these PCC tokens to anybody 
that has a CashTokens compatible Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Canadians are encouraged to help their friends and family install CashTokens compatible Bitcoin Cash wallets, and to freely distribute PCC(People's Canada Coins). 
The aim of this is to show ignorant people the folly of their ways, and hopefully to educate them about the People's Party of Canada and why the party is important, 
and to also educate them about blockchains, cryptocurrencies, Tokens, and Bitcoin Cash.

FULL DISCLOSURE: 

- I am an independent Canadian citizen and card carrying member of the People's Party of Canada, and I am acting independently and of my own accord. While the PCC logo
  bears some resemblance to the People's Party of Canada's logo, on closer inspection it is very different in just about every way. The maple leaf is different—my own
  design, the "C" with a "₵" nested within its negative space is different and of my own design, and "P" itself has different dimensions/scale to the "P" in the official
  People's Party of Canada logo. 

- I do hold Bitcoin Cash(BCH) coins, but it will quickly become apparent that I WILL MAKE NO MONEY OFF PCC(People's Canada Coin). In fact it costs me 
money, time, and effort in order to bring PCC into existence to inform you provincial philistines.
